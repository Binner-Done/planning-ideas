modules can be enabled and disabled at will.

for example one user could disable voice, but it would still work for the best of the users.

some core modules are made by the devs, but the rest are user contributed.


They make a pr, we check it. If accepted it goes into the module repo and onto the site!

Possibly add the ability for guilds to have a custom module without it being checked, however it's just for their guild. Limited features on these unchecked modules possibly.
